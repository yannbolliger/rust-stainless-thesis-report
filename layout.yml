abstract: |
  This project substantially extends the fragment of Rust code that is supported
  by the Rust-frontend of Stainless, a formal verification framework. Most
  notably, it is now possible to extract Stainless type classes with abstract
  methods and attached, automatically proven laws on those methods from Rust
  traits and implementations.
