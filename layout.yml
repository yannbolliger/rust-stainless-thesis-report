abstract: |
  This semester project substantially extends the fragment of Rust code that is
  supported by the Rust-frontend of Stainless, a formal verification framework.
  Most notably, it is now possible to extract Stainless type classes with
  abstract methods and attached, automatically proven laws on those methods from
  Rust traits and implementations.
