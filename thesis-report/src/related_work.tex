\section{Background Topics}

Rust's type and ownership system has been heavily inspired by decades of
research in the programming language area. The main topics to consider are
linear, unique, and ownership types as well as region-based memory management.

Linearity was introduced by \citet{girard} and \citet{Wadler90lineartypes}.
Linear types must be used \emph{exactly once}, they cannot be duplicated nor
discarded \cite{use-once}. This presents the disadvantage that values to be
reused have to be threaded through the program, e.g.~a function that reads from
an array also needs to return the array after the read to make it useable again.
Unique types as described by \citet{alias-free-pointers} on the other hand
guarantee that they are the only reference to a certain value, i.e.~the absence
of aliases. Lastly, \citet{ownership-types} introduce ownership types that
follow the same goal, the absence of inadvertent and even dangerous aliasing of
(heap-allocated) objects.

Many early approaches to linear and unique types originated in functional
languages and some challenges arise when they are applied to object-oriented
languages that may assign to values or clone objects. Shallowly copying an
object in a language with owned data is problematic because it might copy unique
pointers, hence creating illegal aliases. Deep copying would solve the problem
but there is also a more efficient approach called \emph{sheep cloning}. First
described by \citet{dynamic-alias-protection}, Rust implements a version close
to \cite{sheep-cloning}: owned data, that is data pointed at by unique pointers
is deeply copied, while shared data, i.e.~immutable references, can be safely
aliased.

To make unique types work with assignments, values need to be moved or destroyed
after read. This notion of \emph{destructive reads} was introduced by
\citet{islands-alias-protection}, with the goal of protecting from aliasing in
object-oriented languages. Rust implements such reads for its move semantics by
making the borrow checker flow-sensitive, similar to the proposition of
\citet{alias-burying}. The flow-sensitive borrow checker can also be seen as
substructural typing \cite{oxide}.

Other, less practically used languages with substructural typing or
similar ideas are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mezzo}, an ML-language by \citet{mezzo}, controls aliasing
  and ownership by offering \emph{duplicable types} that are immutable
  and can be copied, and on the other hand \emph{mutable types} that are
  linear. This is similar to Rust's distinction of copyable and moveable
  types. Mezzo also uses a flow-sensitive type checker to enforce its
  discipline but it does so with permissions embedded in the type system
  rather than lifetimes.

\item \textbf{Linear Haskell} by \citet{linear-haskell} tries to bring linear
types to Haskell in a backwards-compatible way, i.e.~existing code compiles
alongside linear types. The key difference of this approach is that linearity is
attached to functions instead of having linear and non-linear types like Mezzo
or Rust. A linear function is then restricted in the way it uses its arguments:
when its result is consumed exactly once, then its argument is consumed exactly
once.

\item
  \textbf{Alms} is an attempt to popularise \emph{affine types},
  e.g.~types that may be use \emph{at most once}, by \citet{alms}. The
  language is similar to OCaml and its primary goal is to create
  resource-aware abstractions, for solving problems like race
  conditions. In an Alms module, the programmer can mark types as
  affine, contrary to Rust where everything is moveable, i.e.~affine,
  unless otherwise specified, by implementing
  \passthrough{\lstinline!Copy!}.

\item
  \textbf{Cyclone} was intended as a save alternative to C and is among
  the languages that inspired Rust the most. In particular,
  \citet{cyclone-region} designed Cyclone with memory management based
  on regions that includes ideas like region subtyping and deallocation
  by region. Unlike Rust however, in Cyclone the programmer specifies
  whether an object should be on the heap, on the stack or in a dynamic
  region. In Rust, the lifetime mechanism is applied to all references
  and memory locations, ownership is used to trigger deallocation.
\end{itemize}


\section{Rust Formalisations}

Even if Rust is a rather young language, there have already been
numerous attempts at formalising its semantics of ownership, borrowing
and reference lifetimes. The following list mentions three important and
recent works. Other projects are are Patina \cite{patina}, Rusty
Types \cite{rusty-types}, and KRust \cite{krust}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{RustBelt} by \citet{rustbelt} is important to mention because
  it bridges the gap of most other works: it proves the safety of
  implementations in \emph{unsafe Rust} -- ``securing the foundations of
  Rust''. The authors develop an automated way of proving correctness of
  a subset of the language and apply it to libraries that internally use
  unsafe features. For example, they proved that a program using the
  abstractions of \passthrough{\lstinline!std::cell!} runs safely if it
  type checks. In contrast to the following works and Rust-Stainless
  however, RustBelt uses a continuation-passing style language
  \(\lambda_{Rust}\) that is close to the MIR rather than Rust itself.

\item
  \textbf{Oxide} is a recent formalisation by some of Rust's maintainers
  \citet{oxide}. The goal of the project is to provide formal semantics
  for a language close to surface Rust called Oxide. The authors present
  the first syntactic proof of type safety for the borrow checking of
  (the considered subset of) Rust and implemented a type-checker for the
  language. It is important to note that the interpretation of lifetimes
  in Oxide is already compatible with the future version of Rust's
  borrow checker called \emph{Polonius} \cite{polonius}.

\item
  \textbf{Lightweight Formalism for Rust (FR)} was developed in parallel
  to Oxide by \citet{fr}. Like Oxide, it draws strong inspiration from
  Featherweight Java (FJ) \cite{fj}, hence the name FR. The paper also
  presents a calculus that models source-level Rust with its salient
  features like borrowing, reference lifetimes and move versus copy
  semantics. The authors prove the soundness of their calculus but
  unlike Oxide, they implemented the system in Java rather than in Rust.
  Other differences to Oxide are that FR models boxes, that is heap
  allocation, which Oxide doesn't. Oxide on the other hand is closer to
  non-lexical lifetimes and hence the newer versions of the borrow
  checker, it also covers a larger subset of Rust.
\end{itemize}

The two latter works are of particular importance to this project because these
formalisations could be used to formally prove the correctness of the
translation from \autoref{translation}.

\section{Verification}

Stainless in its current form with its own solver backend called \emph{Inox}
\cite{nicolas} as developed by \citet*{stainless} is the successor of Leon
\cite{leon}. The two systems come out of a long series of works exploring the
possibilites of verifying functional programs, mainly in Scala, with SMT solvers
\cite{smt}, like the early work by \citet{smrp}. Stainless distinguishes itself
from many other verifiers in that it is \emph{counter-example complete}, that is
it produces and minimises counter-examples for all failed verification
conditions.

Of particular interest to this project is the imperative phase of Stainless that
was introduced by \citet{regb} and acts as main backend to the translation
presented in this thesis. The new imperative phase by \citet{new-imperative} is
likely to overcome the current limitations of imperative code in Stain less and
may be the ideal target for Rust-Stainless.

\subsubsection{Rust Verification}

Due to its clear design and promising safety guarantees, Rust is predestined as
implementation language for critical systems. With that arises the need to prove
stronger properties on Rust programs like functional correctness. This is the
major motivation behind this project, but likewise, numerous other projects try
to build verifiers for Rust. The wide interest in the topic can be seen from the
sheer number of projects in the uncomplete list:\footnote{The list of verifiers
largely stems from
\url{https://alastairreid.github.io/rust-verification-tools/}.}

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{RustHorn} \cite{rusthorn} translates Rust into \emph{constrained
Horn clauses} that can be solved by an appropriate solver. The authors prove
correctness of their translation for a formalised subset of Rust including
mutable references, inspired by RustBelt \cite{rustbelt}. Contrary to
Rust-Stainless, RustHorn operates on the MIR. While it mainly proves the absence
of runtime errors, the tool has no features to  express and verify
specifications or higher-level properties of a given program.

\item \textbf{Seer} \cite{seer} stands for \emph{symbolic execution engine for
Rust}. The engine takes the MIR and executes it symbolically with Z3 \cite{z3}
as a solver backend, similar to Stainless. However, as an execution engine the
tool tries to find executions that produce errors but cannot prove stronger
properties.

\item \textbf{SMACK} is a verification toolchain that translates LLVM IR to
Boogie \cite{boogie} and  has been extended to support Rust \cite{smack}. Like
RustHorn, it is able to prove absence of runtime errors and correctness of
assertions but no higher-level properties like laws in Rust-Stainless.

\item \textbf{MIRAI} \cite{mirai} is an abstract interpreter for MIR developed
at Facebook. It supports very similar pre- and postconditions like
Rust-Stainless that are standardised by the \lstinline!contracts! crate. The
repository also contains contracts for many modules in the standard library.
Such a contract could be a solution to Rust-Stainless' one-crate-limitation (cf.
\autoref{impl-limitations}).  Contrary to Stainless, MIRAI may produce false
negatives and  is not able to generate counter-examples for failed verification
conditions.

\item \textbf{Electrolysis} \cite{electrolysis} is probably the most similar
work to Rust-Stainless. It translates Rust to the functional language Lean which
is used as an interactive theorem prover \cite{lean}. Like Rust-Stainless,
Electrolysis only works on the safe subset of Rust and one of the core topics of
the project is the translation of mutable references. The author chooses
functional lenses as representation of mutable references in Lean, this has the
limitation that the translation needs to keep track of the provenance of mutable
references. Unlike Rust-Stainless, this project operates on the MIR.


\item \textbf{Creusot} \cite{creusot} is similar to Electrolysis, it also
translates Rust to a verification language, WhyML \cite{why3}. Like MIRAI,
Prusti and Rust-Stainless, Creusot lets  the programmer state specifications as
pre- and postconditions. However it uses a special language for the contracts,
called \emph{Pearlite}, that is developed with the project. Creusot also works
with the MIR.

\item \textbf{Prusti} \cite{prusti} is probably to most useable tool currently,
as it is the only one  to offer a VSCode extension that verifies properties
while the programmer is writing code. Prusti translates MIR to Viper
\cite{viper}, a larger verification framework with frontends for various
mainstream languages. Like Rust-Stainless, pre- and postconditions are expressed
in Rust itself. Prusti has also the ability to attach contracts to
crate-external items, similar to MIRAI, solving the one-crate-limitation (cf.
\autoref{impl-limitations}). On the other hand, Prusti does not yet offer trait
contract verification like Rust-Stainless introduces in this project with laws.

\end{itemize}

From this extensive enumeration, it is clear that Rust-Stainless is currenlty
the only tool that operates on an IR above the MIR -- the THIR. The trade-offs
involved in that decision are discussed in \autoref{mir-thir}. One advantage
that Rust-Stainless could draw from that decision in the future is
counter-example generation in Rust. Currently, counter-examples are generated
for the translated Scala program but it should be feasible to reverse the
translation and return to the user counter-examples in Rust.
