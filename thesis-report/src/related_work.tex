\section{Background Topics}

Rust's type and ownership system has been heavily inspired by decades of
research in the programming language area. The main topics to consider are
linear, unique, and ownership types as well as region-based memory management.

Linearity was introduced by \citet{girard} and \citet{Wadler90lineartypes}.
Linear types must be used \emph{exactly once}, they cannot be duplicated nor
discarded \cite{use-once}. This presents the disadvantage that values to be
reused have to be threaded through the program, e.g.~a function that reads from
an array also needs to return the array after the read to make it useable again.
Unique types as described by \citet{alias-free-pointers} on the other hand
guarantee that they are the only reference to a certain value, i.e.~the absence
of aliases. Lastly, \citet{ownership-types} introduce ownership types that
follow the same goal, the absence of inadvertent and even dangerous aliasing of
(heap-allocated) objects.

Many early approaches to linear and unique types originated in functional
languages and some challenges arise when they are applied to object-oriented
languages that may assign to values or clone objects. Shallowly copying an
object in a language with owned data is problematic because it might copy unique
pointers, hence creating illegal aliases. Deep copying would solve the problem
but there is also a more efficient approach called \emph{sheep cloning}. First
described by \citet{dynamic-alias-protection}, Rust implements a version close
to \cite{sheep-cloning}: owned data, that is data pointed at by unique pointers
is deeply copied, while shared data, i.e.~immutable references, can be safely
aliased.

To make unique types work with assignments, values need to be moved or destroyed
after read. This notion of \emph{destructive reads} was introduced by
\citet{islands-alias-protection}, with the goal of protecting from aliasing in
object-oriented languages. Rust implements such reads for its move semantics by
making the borrow checker flow-sensitive, similar to the proposition of
\citet{alias-burying}. The flow-sensitive borrow checker can also be seen as
substructural typing \cite{oxide}.

Other, less practically used languages with substructural typing or
similar ideas are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mezzo}, an ML-language by \citet{mezzo}, controls aliasing
  and ownership by offering \emph{duplicable types} that are immutable
  and can be copied, and on the other hand \emph{mutable types} that are
  linear. This is similar to Rust's distinction of copyable and moveable
  types. Mezzo also uses a flow-sensitive type checker to enforce its
  discipline but it does so with permissions embedded in the type system
  rather than lifetimes.

\item \textbf{Linear Haskell} by \citet{linear-haskell} tries to bring linear
types to Haskell in a backwards-compatible way, i.e.~existing code compiles
alongside linear types. The key difference of this approach is that linearity is
attached to functions instead of having linear and non-linear types like Mezzo
or Rust. A linear function is then restricted in the way it uses its arguments:
when its result is consumed exactly once, then its argument is consumed exactly
once.

\item
  \textbf{Alms} is an attempt to popularise \emph{affine types},
  e.g.~types that may be use \emph{at most once}, by \citet{alms}. The
  language is similar to OCaml and its primary goal is to create
  resource-aware abstractions, for solving problems like race
  conditions. In an Alms module, the programmer can mark types as
  affine, contrary to Rust where everything is moveable, i.e.~affine,
  unless otherwise specified, by implementing
  \passthrough{\lstinline!Copy!}.

\item
  \textbf{Cyclone} was intended as a save alternative to C and is among
  the languages that inspired Rust the most. In particular,
  \citet{cyclone-region} designed Cyclone with memory management based
  on regions that includes ideas like region subtyping and deallocation
  by region. Unlike Rust however, in Cyclone the programmer specifies
  whether an object should be on the heap, on the stack or in a dynamic
  region. In Rust, the lifetime mechanism is applied to all references
  and memory locations, ownership is used to trigger deallocation.
\end{itemize}


\section{Rust Formalisations}

Even if Rust is a rather young language, there have already been
numerous attempts at formalising its semantics of ownership, borrowing
and reference lifetimes. The following list mentions three important and
recent works. Other projects are are Patina \cite{patina}, Rusty
Types \cite{rusty-types}, and KRust \cite{krust}.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{RustBelt} by \citet{rustbelt} is important to mention because
  it bridges the gap of most other works: it proves the safety of
  implementations in \emph{unsafe Rust} -- ``securing the foundations of
  Rust''. The authors develop an automated way of proving correctness of
  a subset of the language and apply it to libraries that internally use
  unsafe features. For example, they proved that a program using the
  abstractions of \passthrough{\lstinline!std::cell!} runs safely if it
  type checks. In contrast to the following works and Rust-Stainless
  however, RustBelt uses a continuation-passing style language
  \(\lambda_{Rust}\) that is close to the MIR rather than Rust itself.

\item
  \textbf{Oxide} is a recent formalisation by some of Rust's maintainers
  \citet{oxide}. The goal of the project is to provide formal semantics
  for a language close to surface Rust called Oxide. The authors present
  the first syntactic proof of type safety for the borrow checking of
  (the considered subset of) Rust and implemented a type-checker for the
  language. It is important to note that the interpretation of lifetimes
  in Oxide is already compatible with the future version of Rust's
  borrow checker called \emph{Polonius} \cite{polonius}.

\item
  \textbf{Lightweight Formalism for Rust (FR)} was developed in parallel
  to Oxide by \citet{fr}. Like Oxide, it draws strong inspiration from
  Featherweight Java (FJ) \cite{fj}, hence the name FR. The paper also
  presents a calculus that models source-level Rust with its salient
  features like borrowing, reference lifetimes and move versus copy
  semantics. The authors prove the soundness of their calculus but
  unlike Oxide, they implemented the system in Java rather than in Rust.
  Other differences to Oxide are that FR models boxes, that is heap
  allocation, which Oxide doesn't. Oxide on the other hand is closer to
  non-lexical lifetimes and hence the newer versions of the borrow
  checker, it also covers a larger subset of Rust.
\end{itemize}

The two latter works are of particular importance to this project because these
formalisations could be used to formally prove the correctness of the
translation from \autoref{translation}.

\section{Verification}

Stainless in its current form with its own solver backend called \emph{Inox}
\cite{nicolas} as developed by \citet*{stainless} is the successor of Leon
\cite{leon}. The two systems come out of a long series of works exploring the
possibilites of verifying functional programs, mainly in Scala, with SMT solvers
\cite{smt}, like the early work by \citet{smrp}. Of particular interest to this
project is the imperative phase of Stainless that was introduced by \citet{regb}
and acts as main backend to the translation presented in this thesis. The new
imperative phase by \citet{new-imperative} is likely to overcome the current
limitations of imperative code in Stainless and may be the ideal target for
Rust-Stainless.
