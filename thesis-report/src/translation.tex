Although Rust introduces many features and ideas from functional programming
into systems programming, it still is a language for high performance and
low-level programming. Therefore, idiomatic Rust makes heavy use of mutability.
To avoid having to rewrite Rust source code before being able to verify it with
our tool, we therefore need to support mutability in Rust-Stainless. In this
chapter, I introduce a translation of Rust's owned types and references to Scala
that is equivalent in runtime semantics. Further, I will argue that the
translation is correct and then present some optimisations and usability results
that make it possible to use the translation together with the current state of
the Stainless verifier backend.

\section{Translation for Runtime Equivalence}
\label{sec:translation}

The translation works under the assumption that the input Rust code is the
\emph{safe subset} \cite[section ``Unsafety'']{rustref} of the 2018 edition and
that execution is single-threaded. Further, the translation requires the absence
of \emph{interior mutability} \cite[section ``Interior Mutability'']{rustref}.
That means that all types are immutable through shared references. This can be
enforced by prohibiting the use of \emph{smart pointers} like the ones from
\passthrough{\lstinline!std::cell!}. Moreover, the safe subset of Rust excludes
features like raw pointers, \passthrough{\lstinline!union!}, unsafe functions
and blocks, as well as external code, like linked C-code. In practice, all
unsafe features are detected at extraction of the code and abort the
translation.


\subsection{Algorithm}

The goal of the translation is to bridge the gaps between Rust's and Scala's
memory model -- making references accessible to the programer and allowing
mutability of all struct fields if needed. To achieve the first one and bring
the ability of manipulating references to Scala, I introduce a special wrapper
case class, the \emph{mutable cell}:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, style=short]
case class MutCell[T](var value: t)
\end{lstlisting}

The mutable cell object is used as a layer of indirection on all Scala values
and directly models the \emph{place} of a value, where the value is stored in
the field (\lstinline!value!). Note that the field is mutable, which in
principle allows changes to any place. After the translation, the mutable cell's
field will even be the only mutable variable. All mutability in the original
Rust program will be modelled with that field.

\begin{quote}
Whenever something is (possibly) mutable, we wrap it into a mutable cell.
\end{quote}

Local variables are wrapped into mutable cells, regardless of their mutability
in Rust. This enables taking references to local variables which is needed for
both mutable and immutable variables. The approach also allows to create
references to data of primitive types like integers, something that is
impossible to do in Scala directly.

Likewise, all \lstinline!struct!, \lstinline!enum!, and tuple fields are mutable
cells with the type of the original field as the type argument of the cell.
Thereby, the translation achieves its second goal from above -- all fields are
\emph{possibly} mutable. In other words, every place in the Rust program is
modelled by the introduction of a mutable cell object. Hence, all place
expressions in the original program correspond to exactly one mutable cell
instance in the translation.

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, caption={Example Rust struct.}]
struct A<T> {
  a: T, b: i32
}
let x = A {
  a: "foo", b: 123
}
let mut y = 123
assert!(y == x.b)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.52\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Scala,
  caption=The fields of the struct are modelled with mutable
  cells as are the two let-bindings.
]
case class A[T](
  a: MutCell[T], b: MutCell[Int]
)
val x = MutCell(
  A(MutCell("foo"), MutCell(123))
)
val y = MutCell(123)
assert(y.value == x.value.b.value)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}


\subsubsection{Tuples}

As for all structs, the mutability of tuples is decided at binding time in Rust,
contrary to Scala, where tuples are always immutable. To allow for tuple
mutation in Rust, tuples of any positive arity are translated as case classes
instead of Scala tuples. The following example shows  such a class for a
2-tuple. The empty tuple corresponds to the unit type in Rust and is translated
as such.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala, style=short]
case class Tuple2[T0, T1](_0: MutCell[T0], _1: MutCell[T1])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Using Data}

If a field or a variable is read, the translation introduces an access to the
\passthrough{\lstinline!value!} field of the corresponding cell. The same
happens for dereferencing. In other words, any place expression that is
evaluated in a value context is translated as reading the
\passthrough{\lstinline!value!} of the corresponding mutable cell object. This
shows how our translation unifies the access of locally available bindings and
references that may come from elsewhere.

\paragraph{Copy vs moving}

When place expressions are used in value contexts their data is used, i.e.~moved
or copied. Subsection \ref{sec:correctness-by-value} argues that the translation
is correct as-is for moveable types. However, for copyable types, the
translation needs to ensure that the newly created copy is distinct from the
original object.

This holds trivially for primitive JVM types as they are copied by value on the
JVM as well. The same goes for shared Rust references, where the reference is
copied but still points to the same object. Because the reference is shared, the
designated object must be immutable, hence sharing is the same as copying.
However, tuples of copyable types, for example tuples of numbers, are copyable
as well in Rust. This is a problem for the translation. If it allows tuple
objects to be shared upon a copy in Scala, the example in
\autoref{lst:tuple-share} would be incorrect.

\begin{figure}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.3\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust, caption={The tuple is copied on line 2.}, label={lst:tuple-share}]
let x = (123, false);

// copies `x`
let mut y = x;

y.0 = 456;
// holds:
assert!(x.0 == 123)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.67\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Scala,
  label=lst:tuple-sharing,
  caption=In Scala the tuple object is shared not copied.
]
val x =
  MutCell(Tuple2(MutCell(123), MutCell(false)))
// shares tuple object `x.value`
val y = MutCell(x.value)
// i.e. x.value == y.value
y.value._0.value = 456
// fails:
assert(x.value._0.value == 123)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


To avoid such problems, the translation introduces two operators in Scala:
\passthrough{\lstinline!move[T](t: T): T!} and
\passthrough{\lstinline!copy[T](t: T): T!}. They can be thought of as top-level
functions that perform a deep copy of their argument. An implementation for
these operators could be based on type classes for example, but implementation
details are left open here. Whenever data is used, the translation wraps the
field access of the cell's \lstinline!value! into one of the two operators,
depending on the type of the data. For example in \autoref{lst:tuple-sharing} on
line 4, the right-hand side of the assignment becomes
\lstinline!MutCell(copy(x.value))!. For primitive JVM types, this can be omitted
as an optimisation because they are also copied on the JVM.

User-defined copyable types, i.e. types for which the user derives a Copy
implementation with a macro, run into the same issue as copyable tuples. The
translation currently ignores these because the current state of our extraction
implementation does not yet accept such types. Nonetheless, the solution would
be to use the \lstinline!copy! operator as well.

\subsubsection{Referencing}

A borrow in Rust creates a reference to a place and makes that reference
available as a value in the program. After translation the place expression in
Rust is equivalent to the JVM reference of the cell object. Hence, passing
around Rust references as values can be translated to passing around cell
objects in Scala. (Passing around the cells conveniently happens by reference on
the JVM.)

As an example, if a Rust reference is stored in a local variable, this creates
two nested cells in the translation. The outer cell models the local variable
and the value of its field holds the other cell which models the Rust reference.

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
let x: T = ...;
let r = &mut x;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
val x = MutCell[T](...)
val r = MutCell(x)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Matching}

\begin{figure}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Rust,
  caption={In the first case, \lstinline!a! binds the value of \lstinline!x.a!
  whereas in the other cases it is \lstinline!&mut x.a!.}
]
match x {
    A { a, .. } => ...
}
match &mut x {
  A { a, .. } => ...
}
match x {
  A { mut ref a, .. } => ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Scala,
  caption={In the first case, \lstinline!a! matches the field \lstinline!value!
    of the cell, whereas in the other cases it matches the cell object.},
  label={lst:pattern-match}
]
x.value match {
    case A(MutCell(a), _) => ...
}
x match {
    case MutRef(A(a, _)) => ...
}
x.value match {
    case A(a, _) => ...
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

The same principles apply for pattern matching as for evaluating place
expressions. If a match happens on a value, the Scala match will be on the
\passthrough{\lstinline!value!} field of that cell. If the scrutinee is a
reference, then the Scala scrutinee is the mutable cell. The patterns are
adapted to include the mutable cell wrappers of fields. Depending on whether a
resulting binding of a match is a reference or not in Rust, the Scala pattern
matches the cell or only its field, see \autoref{lst:pattern-match}.


\subsubsection{Assigning}

Mutating values in both Rust and Scala is done by assigning new rvalues
to lvalues. The translation for assignments is analogous to the one for
accessing places and again unifies local variables and references. If a
place expression is assigned an rvalue, the translation assigns to the
\passthrough{\lstinline!value!} field of the cell, no matter whether the
place expression is a local variable or a mutable reference.

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Rust]
let x: &mut i32 = ...
*x = 123;
let mut y = 456;
y = 789;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
val x: MutCell[Int] = ???
x.value = 123
val y = MutCell(456)
y.value = 789
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Function parameters}

Rust functions can take parameters by reference or by value. This is modelled in
the translation by wrapping the parameter in a mutable cell or directly passing
it ``by value'' -- in the JVM sense. Additionally, it is possible to declare the
parameter binding as mutable by marking it \passthrough{\lstinline!mut!}. To
model that local mutability, the translation again wraps the parameter in a
mutable cell. This is done regardless of whether the parameter is locally
mutable to keep the invariant that each place corresponds to one cell. At
function call site, all arguments are wrapped into newly created cells to ensure
that local mutations on these parameters remain local to the callee.

\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Rust,
  caption={\lstinline!i! is only mutable inside the function.}
]
fn f(
  mut i: i32,
  x: &i32
) { ... }
let r = 123;
f(456, &r);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.45\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Scala]
def f(
  i: MutCell[Int],
  x: MutCell[MutCell[Int]]
) = ???
val r = MutCell(r)
f(MutCell(456), MutCell(r))
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{Boxes}

Contrary to the JVM, where all objects live on the heap, Rust lets the
programmer allocate objects on the heap with boxes. However, for verification it
does not matter, whether something is on the heap or the stack as long as
general memory safety is preserved. Therefore, this distinction can be erased in
the translation and everything uses normal heap-allocated Scala objects.

\subsubsection{Memory Replace}

To allow for in-place updates of mutable references, the translation supports
the  Rust function \lstinline!std::mem::replace!. With all the machinery
introduced so far, the function can be translated as a simple feature on top of
the \lstinline!move! and \lstinline!copy! operators, as shown in
\autoref{lst:replace}. Interestingly, the translation corresponds quite closely
to the implementation -- in unsafe code -- of the function in the standard
library.\footnote{\href{}{\texttt{\color{MidnightBlue}
https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/core/mem/mod.rs.html\#815}}}

\begin{figure}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.4\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Rust,
  caption={Replacing a mutable reference's value.}
]
fn f(a: &mut A) -> A {
  std::mem::replace(
    a,
    A { a: "bar", b: 0 }
  )
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.55\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Scala,
  caption={The translation of the replace function.},
  label={lst:replace}
]
def f(a: MutCell[A]): A = {
  val res = move(a.value)
  a.value = A(MutCell("bar"), MutCell(0))
  res
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}



\subsection{Correctness}
\label{correctness-claim}

\begin{quote}
Under the assumption that the original Rust program type and borrow
checks, I argue that the described translation of mutable Rust
references and owned types to mutable cells in Scala is equivalent in
runtime semantics, i.e.~when run the Scala translation yields the same
result as the Rust program.
\end{quote}

The Rust borrow checker ensures that there is no unsafely aliased state,
i.e.~aliased state that is mutated, in the original program. It may seem that
this is an unnecessarily strict assumption, but Rust's ownership system is so
fundamental to the language that it is impossible to define Rust's semantics
without borrow checking \cite{krust}. Consider \autoref{lst:move-err}, because
\lstinline!y! moves out \lstinline!x! on line 3, \lstinline!x! can never be
reused and its value is undefined, even if some code could illegally read it
again. Therefore, the borrow check assumption is necessary to reason about the
semantics of the original program.

\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Rust,
  label=lst:move-err,
  caption={This code does not compile due to the use after move in line 5.}
]
struct A { a: i32 };
let x = A { a: 123 };
let mut y = x;  // `x` is moved to `y`
y.a = 456;
assert!(x.a == 123) // ERROR, can't reuse `x`
\end{lstlisting}

The translation introduces a bijection between Rust places and mutable cell
objects. As seen before, places can be variables or fields. The translation
wraps each local variable, each function parameter and each field into a mutable
cell, hence, each of these places corresponds to exactly one cell. Arrays would
differ from that but they are not supported yet.

Secondly, observe that the translation unifies the access to values, as seen
above. Dereferencing and using a local variable are both done through the cell
object's field. In a way, the translation lifts everything into references; even
local variables are accessed through the single gateway to the value that is the
cell object. Furthermore, the cell's field is the only location where program
data can reside. This corresponds to Rust's principle that data is always owned
uniquely (by a cell) and otherwise referenced (through the cell).

More formally, I examine the three ways in which data can be accessed in Rust to
argue that our translation results in correct Scala runtime semantics.

\subsubsection{By value}
\label{sec:correctness-by-value}

If data is used by value, it transfers ownership to the new binding. This holds
for both moveable and copyable types. Only for the latter, the original binding
and data stay intact, whereas for moveable types, the original owner is
invalidated and the data de-initialised. In both cases, if the used data is
later mutated, changes will not appear on the original binding. Therefore, the
translation is correct in inserting the \lstinline!move! or \lstinline!copy!
operator -- which for this argument can be taken as deep copies -- around
by-value reads of a cell's data.

Performing a deep copy for moveable types is correct because the original
binding can never be reused. Thus, one can think of moving as performing a deep
copy of the original object, assigning it to a new binding and then destroying
the original object. Importantly, the changes made to the moved object never
propagate back to the original.

For copyable types, the translation distinguishes between aggregate types and
primitive types. Primitive JVM types are handled the same as in Rust and need no
further examination. Aggregate types like tuples of numbers are translated to
Scala objects with mutable cells as fields. Therefore, I need to show that the
deep object copy our \lstinline!copy! operator performs is equivalent to the
implicit bitwise copy of the struct in Rust.

Indeed, bitwise copy for an aggregate type is trivially the same as deep copy as
long as all contained types are present by value. That means all contained data
is embedded in the bits of the aggregate structure and is simply copied deeply
as well. It gets more complicated for shared references (mutable references are
not copyable as they need to be unique). For a shared reference, Rust simply
copies the reference, i.e.~the pointer value, but not the referenced object.
Still, that operation is equivalent to a deep copy because the references are
shared. Thus, by the borrow check assumption, as long as any shared reference to
an object exists, that object cannot be mutated. In other words, under our
assumptions a shared reference will never see its referenced value change.
Therefore, it is equivalent to copy that object deeply when needed, the sharing
can be viewed simply as an optimisation in Rust.

The above holds for tuples, arrays and user-defined \lstinline!Copy! types as
long as our \lstinline!copy! operator supports them in Scala. Other copyable
types like raw pointers and function pointers are not supported by the
translation nor our extraction.

\subsubsection{By reference}

The counterpart of using data and transferring its ownership is taking
references to places. The translation handles that by using the place's cell
object which is defined and unique, as shown earlier. Thanks to the cells it
becomes possible to reference places on the JVM; it suffices to mention, i.e.~to
use, the correct cell object whenever a reference is needed. Cells are JVM
objects, hence, they can simply be used in a by-value manner and reference
handling is done by the JVM.

In particular, when a cell is used in multiple locations it will not be cloned
but all the locations will point to the same cell object. This exactly
corresponds to the semantics of shared Rust references that are model by the
cells and is thus correct.

For mutable references, the mechanism is entirely the same. Any changes made on
a cell's value will be visible to all readers, because they share the cell
object. This sounds dangerous but the borrow check assumption guarantees that no
illegal sharing or aliasing can occur. For example it is guaranteed that all
shared references to an object end their lifetime \emph{before} the object is
mutated. In the translation, such a shared reference in the form of a cell
object might still exist somewhere on the JVM before the garbage collector
passes, but it will never be read, thanks to the borrow checking. Hence, the
translation is correct for mutable references as well.



\section{Translation for Stainless}

The translation presented so far results in correct Scala runtime semantics, but
the motivation was to ultimately use the translation to verify the Scala program
with Stainless. Intuitively, the translated program can just be submitted to
Stainless to get a verification result and deduce verification properties for
the Rust program. That approach is correct because both programs exhibit the
same runtime semantics. However, Stainless has some limitations concerning its
support for mutability. Therefore, I adapt the general translation step-by-step
to yield Scala programs that are accepted by Stainless.

This section presents the changes made to the translation to be compatible with
Stainless on a theoretical level. Like before, I will argue  that all the
deviations from the general translation uphold the overall correctness. For more
low-level implementation details and an overview of the entire system please
refer to \autoref{implementation}.



\subsection{Avoiding Aliasing}
\label{sec:aliasing-restrictions}

The main difference between Scala and the supported imperative fragment of
Stainless \cite[section ``Imperative'']{stainless-doc} is that Stainless imposes
aliasing restrictions on the program. The restrictions permit a simple but
strict aliasing invariant:

\begin{quote}
{[}For{]} each object in the system, each path of pointers reaches a
distinct area of the heap. \cite[p.~59]{regb}
\end{quote}

Concretely, the following restrictions apply to mutable types, i.e. types that
may contain \lstinline!var! fields or type parameters marked with
\lstinline!@mutable!:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For a function call, no mutable arguments of the call can share any
  part of their memory. E.g. in a function call it is not allowed to
  give an object as one argument and a field of the same object as
  another argument.
\item
  More generally, ``it is forbidden to assign a mutable variable to a
  new identifier'',
\item
  and lastly, ``a function cannot return an object that shares memory
  locations with one of its parameters'' \cite[p.~59]{regb}.
\end{itemize}

As the translation uses mutable cells everywhere, virtually all resulting Scala
types are mutable and fall under these restrictions. On the other hand, the
motivation of Stainless's aliasing restrictions is to make its imperative code
elimination phase work \cite{regb}. That transformation relies on the fact, that
there is a single path to a mutable object. However, the restrictions are quite
severe and there are plenty of cases where an alias is safe but is not allowed
by these rules.\footnote{For example, when there are shared references,
i.e.~aliases, of a mutable object but that object is never changed.}

In Rust, the borrow checker ensures a very similar property: there is a
\emph{unique} mutable reference to a place or otherwise it is safe to have
multiple immutable references. The borrow check assumption guarantees that the
program does not have illegal aliasing of mutable state, but the translation
needs to convince Stainless of that fact. It does so with the \lstinline!move!
and \lstinline!copy! operators.

The translation already introduces \lstinline!move! and \lstinline!copy! when
data is used by value. To work around Stainless's aliasing restrictions it
additionally introduces \lstinline!copy! for function arguments that are shared
references and lastly, it adds \lstinline!move! or \lstinline!copy! to return
values of functions and inner blocks, unless the values contain mutable
references. The correctness of that approach follows from the same argument as
the correctness of using \lstinline!move! and \lstinline!copy! for using data by
value (see \autoref{sec:correctness-by-value}).

To summarise, all types are \lstinline!move!'d or \lstinline!copy!'d when they
could create an alias except for types that are or contain mutable references.
The borrow checker has made sure that the latter are not aliased. Hence, the
resulting program contains no aliasing of mutable types but still preserves
correct runtime semantics.

\subsubsection{\texttt{move} is the identity}

This subsection shows that the \lstinline!move! operator -- though very useful
to work with Stainless -- is not necessary to the semantical correctness of the
translation and may be omitted by implementations that do not need to comply
with Stainless's aliasing restrictions.

\begin{quote}
Under the assumption that the original Rust program type and borrow checks, the
\lstinline!move! operator is semantically equivalent to the identity and simply
serves as a way to make verification work with a simple aliasing analysis.
\end{quote}

As seen before, one can think of moving as performing a deep copy and
invalidating the original. By copying during a move, one can avoid creating an
alias to the source cell. But the borrow checker guarantees that a moved out
value is never used again, hence the original will never be used again and its
value does not matter for the correctness of the program.

It is easier, to see the argument on the example of \autoref{lst:move-err}. On
line 3, the struct is moved out of \lstinline!x! into \lstinline!y!, that is,
without the \lstinline!move! an alias of \lstinline!x!'s cell would be created.
But the binding from \lstinline!x! will never be used again, hence this alias
does not matter and the inserted \lstinline!move! only serves to communicate
this fact to the simple aliasing analysis of Stainless. The same holds for
function arguments and return values. Thus, in order to only achieve correct
Scala runtime semantics, the \lstinline!move! can be omitted because it is
equivalent to the identity.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\texttt{copy} is the functional
identity}{copy is the functional identity}}

The second claim only concerns completely functional programs, that is, programs
that do not mutate any data.

\begin{quote}
Under the assumption that the original Rust program type and borrow checks, and
in the absence of \emph{all mutation}, the \lstinline!copy! operator is
semantically equivalent to the identity and simply serves as a way to make
verification work with a simple aliasing analysis.
\end{quote}

Consider \autoref{lst:tuple-sharing}, the introduced aliasing of the tuple
object is fixed by adding the \lstinline!copy! operator. But the aliasing only
poses a problem because the tuple is later modified. If the tuple wasn't
modified, sharing would be safe and the program correct.

More generally, in the absence of mutation, there are only shared references and
immutable by-value bindings. For the latter, if data needs to be copied
according to Rust semantics but is immutable, then it is safe to share the cell
objects in the translation because the data cannot be changed at any time. The
same holds for shared references. Remember that a shared reference can never see
its referenced data change, therefore it is safe to deeply copy the referenced
object. But again, if that data cannot change at all, one may as well share the
objects. This shows that the \lstinline!copy! operator is equivalent to the
identity in programs without mutation.

\subsubsection{Cloning is copying}
\label{sec:clone-is-copy}

Unlike the built-in implicit copy that occurs for copyable Rust types, a clone
always happens explicitly by calling \lstinline!clone()!. Programmers can define
their own implementation of the \lstinline!Clone! trait or they can let the
\lstinline!derive! macro generate one.

\begin{quote}
Under the assumption that all \lstinline!Clone! instances in a program are
derived by the macro, \lstinline!clone! is equivalent to a deep copy. Thus,
\lstinline!clone! is correctly translated with the \lstinline!copy! operator.
\end{quote}

Derived \lstinline!Clone! instances for struct types recursively call
\lstinline!clone! on all the fields and return a new struct with the cloned
fields. For copyable types, especially primitive types, the clone is trivially a
bitwise copy like for
\lstinline!Copy!.\footnote{\url{https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html}}
For shared references, \autoref{sec:correctness-by-value} shows that copying is
equivalent to a deep copy of the referenced object.

By a simple inductive argument, if the \lstinline!Clone! instances of all the
fields are equivalent to deep copies, then so is the struct's \lstinline!Clone!
instance. Hence, as long as all component types recursively are copyable types
or have derived \lstinline!Clone! instances, the top-level instance is
equivalent to a deep copy. The translation can therefore check that assumption
and if it holds, translate calls to \lstinline!clone! with our \lstinline!copy!
operator, that is the identity in completely functional programs or performs a
deep copy otherwise.



\subsection{Optimisations}
\label{optimisations}

Even if the translation presented here serves to add mutability features to
Rust-Stainless, it should preserve the well-functioning parts of the frontend
that deal with immutable Rust. To that end, the translation that is really
implemented in software contains some optimisations that increase the usability
of Rust-Stainless for functional Rust code. The following subsection presents
the optimisations and again shows their correctness.


\subsubsection{Immutable Bindings and References}

The most important optimisation is that immutable bindings (local variables,
function parameters) are not wrapped in mutable cells. Moreover, shared
references are erased, like boxes, and their values  are used directly. It is
possible to perform this optimisation thanks to excellent support of the Rust
compiler which provides type information for every expression. With that, it is
possible to distinguish immutable values and shared references at all times from
possibly mutable ones that are still wrapped in cells.

To convince the reader of the correctness of this optimisation, first note that
only mutable data can be borrowed mutably. In other words, only for mutable data
do we need the reference sharing in the translation, to propagate changes back
to the original binding. For immutable data, there are no changes in the first
place. Secondly, it is safe to directly use immutable values instead of
references, even if the values get copied at some points, as
\autoref{sec:correctness-by-value} showed. Therefore, it is correct to erase
shared references and use their referred value directly.

\subsubsection{Preventing Aliasing}

Previous sections showed how \lstinline!move! and \lstinline!copy! are used to
emit code that complies with Stainless's aliasing restrictions. They also argued
that \lstinline!copy! \emph{must} perform a semantical deep copy, while
\lstinline!move! \emph{may} do a deep copy but might also be the identity. Our
Stainless-backed implementation, uses a special Stainless primitive to emulate
both operators: \lstinline!freshCopy[T](t: T): T!, performs a semantical deep
copy of its argument. Because Rust-Stainless serves to verify Rust code, it does
not matter that deep copy incurs a performance cost because the translated code
is never run.

The implementation decides for each location where data is used by value whether
to insert a \lstinline!freshCopy! or not based on the type of the data. Types
that are or contain mutable references, like \lstinline!Option<&mut T>!, are not
\lstinline!freshCopy!'d and the copy is omitted for primitive JVM types.
Additionally, the translation avoids \lstinline!freshCopy! around some control
structures for by design it is clear that a \lstinline!freshCopy! will be
inserted inside the structure. For example in a \lstinline!match! expression,
the resulting value of each arm will be copied and therefore the entire match
expression doesn't need an additional copy.

For cloning, the same procedure is applied. Conveniently, the Rust compiler does
not derive \lstinline!Clone! instances for types that are or contain mutable
references.\footnote{\href{}{\texttt{\color{MidnightBlue}
https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html\#impl-Clone-121}}}
Therefore, it is sufficient to check the assumption from
\autoref{sec:clone-is-copy} to make sure that all types for which clone is
translated will be \lstinline!freshCopy!'d'.

To summarise, the implementation deeply copies some of the moves to prevent
aliasing in the resulting code. But, it never copies mutable references because
for those, the Rust compiler has made sure that there are no aliases. Lastly,
the same happens for cloning because, by the check, only clone operations are
extracted for which these semantics are correct.


\subsection{Limitations}
\label{trans-limitations}

So far, mutable cells together with the \lstinline!freshCopy! primitive solved
all cases of aliasing restriction problems. However, one particular pattern will
still run into the aliasing restrictions of Stainless, the mutable binding of a
mutable reference: \passthrough{\lstinline!mut x: &mut T!}. The variable
\lstinline!x! is mutable in two ways, it can be dereferenced and assigned
\lstinline!*x = ...! which changes the referred object, but it can also be
reassigned with another mutable reference \lstinline!x = &mut ...!. To correctly
translate both of these, the variable must be translated as
\lstinline!MutCell[MutCell[T]]!. This is in fact what our translation does. An
example of such a translation is in \autoref{lst:nested-cell}.

\begin{figure}
\noindent\begin{minipage}[t]{.35\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Rust,
  caption={A mutable reference in a mutable variable.}
]
let mut a = 123;
let mut b = 456;
let mut r = &mut a;

r = &mut b;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{.6\textwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[
  language=Scala,
  label=lst:nested-cell,
  caption={Translation with nested mutable cells.}
]
val a: MutCell[Int] = MutCell[Int](123)
val b: MutCell[Int] = MutCell[Int](123)
val r: MutCell[MutCell[Int]] =
  MutCell[MutCell[Int]](a)
r.value = MutCell[Int](b)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Note that the code of \autoref{lst:nested-cell} runs correctly in Scala, hence
the runtime equivalence is upheld. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about
Stainless. The assignment on line 5 of \autoref{lst:nested-cell} creates an
alias of \lstinline!b! in \lstinline!r.value!, which Stainless does not permit.
In other words, the translation for Stainless is fundamentally limited by the
aliasing restrictions in that it cannot translate mutable references in mutable
bindings. This can occur for local variables as in the example or also for
\lstinline!mut! function parameters of mutable reference type.

\hfill \break \noindent This chapter presented a translation for mutability from
Rust to Scala and refined it in several steps to make it useable with the
imperative phase of Stainless. For each transformation, I argued that the
overall property of runtime equivalence is upheld. The last section discussed a
theoretical limitation of the approach. Further limitations that are more
associated with the implementation  of the translation are discussed in
\autoref{impl-limitations}. More generally, the next chapter sheds light on the
engineering of Rust-Stainless and other new features than mutability.
