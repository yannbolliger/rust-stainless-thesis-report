Presented tool

showed efficacy with evaluation.
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item fast translation
\item useability with actual crates/code
\end{itemize}

With mutability, freshCopy and mem::replace the frontend is now almost more
expressive than Stainless itself!

In particular, can implement and verify actual, performant code


\paragraph{Extraction}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item adding the missing features: loops, arrays mainly

\item   external items!, would solve problems for
\item vectors (more generally std items and stainless lib)
\item but also for type classes (could you use the real ones)

\item speaking of lib: that would unlock verified data structures by Samuel Chassot + list-map
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Mutability}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item probably maxed out current approach with current imperative phase,
  because bugs

\item even if no bugs: theoretical aliasing limitations by design
\item nested mutable cells
\item recursive functions returning mutable ref

\item Solution: new imperative phase!

\item par contre, using THIR seems like a good idea!

\item also in comparison with other tools: counter-example generation for Rust!
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{New Ideas}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  use Rust instead of Scala + Stainless + GenC?
\item
  use Rust to create WASM?
\item
  smart contracts in Rust/WASM
\item
  Non-conflicting policies for Hermes relayer
\end{itemize}
